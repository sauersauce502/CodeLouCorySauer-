	<main><p>SmashZone is a local staple, operating from the start with local people and local ingredients. Hiring a few friends, family and some neighborhood regulars we were able to jumpstart a food movement that we are prized on growing into the future. Hey, I am Cory Sauer owner and operator of SmashZone I've lived in Germantown since I was born and loved it so much that I decided to try an give back the best way I know how. From our opening we have prided ourselves on using ingredients found only within our Louisville market sourced from the best vendors we can find. Our idea of success starts with the you the customer and the experience we can give you; if you leave satisfied and full, then we have accomplished our goal.</p>
	      <ol>
		<li>Owned and operated by locals and Sauer family members</li>
		<li>Established in 2018</li>
		<li>Serving only the finest locally marketed produce and meat</li>
		<li>Over 50 craft beers along with more than 20 local crafts</li>
	      </ol>
	      <p>Being in the heart of Germantown in Louisville, KY; there's a lot of local people who have German ancestry and background. Knowing this we try our hardest to cater to the tastes that each of our customers knew so well as children and continue to make for their own family. We specialize in ZoneWraps which are quick and easy for everyone to enjoy whenever; yet we also try to give them a local twist as well. On top of that we offer hand-mixed milkshakes, malts and sundaes along with made-from-scratch pies and cake to suit any sweet tooth you may have. Examples of what we serve are:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>ZoneWraps</li>
		<li>Sausage & Kraut</li>
		<li>Beer Cheese Soup</li>
		<li>German Chocolate Malts</li>
	      </ul>    </main>
