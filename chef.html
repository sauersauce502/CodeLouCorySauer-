In this philosophy we found our head chef and star of the show, Kristopher "WolfGang" Craven. Growing up only minutes from our storefront, Mr. Craven is very well-known in the neighborhood and amongst our customers. His one desire is to create the perfect meal for each hungry mouth; he starts with only the finest ingredients and creates everything from scratch with his own homemade recipes. He is a culinary master having studied at the Le Cordon Bleu academy, while also serving time under some of the most renowned chefs in Paris, France. Make a trip down to see us and I guarantee you'll see Chef Craven hard at work putting his heart and love for his community into each and every plate served.</p>
