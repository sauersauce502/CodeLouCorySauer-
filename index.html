		<p>Greetings from Louisville, Kentucky; in the heart of the Germantown/Schnitzelurg neighborhood. We're SmashZone and we're here to fulfill your stomach's desires. We cater to big mouths; big appetites and we serve our grub up with big personalities to match. Our employees are helpful attentive and go that extra mile to make sure that your dine-in, carry-out or delivery experience is as good as it gets. We specialize in quick tasty food that'll suit your lifestyle whether that be sticking around and dining in or if your always on the go. We pride ourselves in offering German-inspired traditional recipes as well. If you find yourself in the neighborhood and you want a bite to eat, come through the zone and get your fix today! </p>
		<p>Open 7 days a week, SmashZone is always your go-to for a delicious snack, meal or treat. We offer both dine-in and carry-out along with local delivery to any customers within 2 miles of our store. We also support the working-class people out there and know that not everyone gets to get off at a decent time, so we stay open till 2am most nights so that everyone has a chance to try our delicious food. Our delivery service is only within 2 miles for the moment with plans to branch out further; however, for the time being, we can bring a delicious entree or any signature ZoneWrap straight to your door for no delivery charge whatsoever.</p>
